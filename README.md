This project is a simple web application developed as part of my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering.
It was created for a university assignment focused on practicing PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.

The application simulates a Halloween costume contest, where users can register, log in, upload their costumes, and vote for their favorites.
An admin panel allows the administrator to manage (CRUD) all costumes and uploaded photos.

This project aims to demonstrate basic web development concepts such as:

User authentication and session handling

Secure form processing and file uploads

Database CRUD operations using MySQLi

Dynamic front-end rendering with PHP and CSS styling

Developed for academic purposes, Paradigms and Programming Languages III.
